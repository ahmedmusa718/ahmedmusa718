                    <h1 align="center">Biography</h1>
                               <p>Ahmed Musa (born 14 October 1992) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as a forward and left winger for Nigerian club Kano Pillars and the Nigeria national team. 
                                Musa became the first Nigerian to score more than once in a FIFA World Cup match, after scoring twice against Argentina in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
                                Musa is also the first Nigerian to score in two FIFA World Cup competitions, after scoring twice against Iceland in the group stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Musa was a member of the Al Nassr squad that won the Saudi Premier League and Saudi Super Cup, both in 2019. </p><br><br>
                                <p><b> Early career</b></p>
                                   <p> Musa began his career in the GBS Football Academy.</p><br> 
                                   <p><b> Breakthrough in Nigeria</b> <br>
                                    In 2008, Musa was loaned to JUTH F.C. where he played 18 games, scoring four goals in his first two professional seasons for the Healers. He was subsequently loaned to Kano Pillars F.C., in the 2009–10 season where he set the league record scoring multiple crucial goals as Pillars finished second. 
                                    Musa held the record for the highest goals ever scored in one season in the history of the Nigeria Premier League until November 2011, when Jude Aneke of Kaduna United F.C. set a new record of 20 goals. 
                                    </p><br>
                                    <p><b>VVV-Venlo</b></p>
                                     <p>Musa was transferred to Dutch club VVV-Venlo in summer 2010, but the move was held up because he was only 17 years of age and therefore not eligible for an ITC in accordance with the current FIFA rules. He was officially eligible to play for VVV-Venlo on 14 October 2010 when he eventually turned 18 years of age.
                                     Less than a week after arriving at the club, Musa made his debut for VVV-Venlo against FC Groningen on 30 October. He started the game for VVV-Venlo, was fouled in the 50th minute and received a penalty kick. </p>
                                  </p>
                                  <p> Rated by Goal.com amongst the Hot 100 young football stars in the world to watch in 2011, Lolade Adewuyi of Goal.com put him on the list of Top Ten Nigerian International Players of 2010 and was also included in IFFHS list of the best 140 players in the world. 
                                    On 8 March 2011, Ahmed Musa won the AIT footballer of the year award (national). The ceremony was held at the Presidential Hotel, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The event had in attendance, BBC African Footballer of the Year winner, Ghanaian Asamoah Gyan and the top officials from the Nigerian football federation including the president Aminu Maigari.

                                    <p>In April, Venlo's football director Mario Captien said that representatives of Tottenham Hotspur had visited the club regarding the player, also Ajax scout Tijani Babangida said that Ajax were interested in Musa but that the outcome would be decided at the end of the season. </p><br>
                                    <p>On 1 May 2011, Musa hit a brace to sink Feyenoord 3–2 and end any lingering fears of automatic relegation from the Eredivisie. <br>
                                        <p>In August 2011, after returning from the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia, Musa made his first appearance of the 2011–12 season at home against AFC Ajax and scored two goals. <br>
                                        In September VVV-Venlo chairman Hai Berden disclosed on Eredivisie Live that VVV-Venlo had turned down a last minute bid of €10 million euros for Musa from the Bundesliga. The name of the Bundesliga club was not disclosed. </p><br><br>

On 1 June 2015, Musa signed a new four-year contract with CSKA until the end of the 2018–19 season.
